# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis
- The purpose of the analysis is to create a dynamic web page that displays data for UFO sightings in the US. The page should be visually appealing and interactive - using           intuitive filters that would enhace user experience.

## Results
- The web page is designed to accept user input and adjust the data table accordingly. Fields of search criteria are provided in which ufologists and non-ufologists alike may       interact with the page by clicking in the and using their keyboard type in one of several criteria and the data table would change accordingly (see example search result in the   image below):
- To search by date; type in the date in the Enter Date field in the format m/d/yyyy the press Enter
- To search by city; type in name of the city in the Enter City field in lower-case then press Enter
- To search by a US state; type in the abbreviated name of the state in the Enter State field in lower-case then press Enter
- To search by shape of the UFO sighted; type one of the following - circle, triangle, light, formation, disk, firewall, sphere, or unknown in the Enter Shape field in lower-case   then press Enter

## Summary
- Major drawbacks of the site are that one has to type in data and it is filtered one criterion at a time. I would recommed pull down menus for the different fields with mouse       clicks for input by user.
